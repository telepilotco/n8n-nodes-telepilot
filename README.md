## Overview

`@telepilotco/n8n-nodes-telepilot` is a node for the n8n automation engine that provides the ability to configure your personal Telegram assistant. 
It works alongside your main client, allowing you to interact with Telegram servers and see all the messages you can see, 
while also enabling your assistant to react to those messages.

With `@telepilotco/n8n-nodes-telepilot`, you can enhance your Telegram user experience by automating various actions and responses. 
Your personal Telegram CoPilot acts as real-time assistant, providing additional functionalities and making your Telegram usage more efficient.

At [TelePilot](https://telepilot.co), we prioritize your privacy. We do not have access to your Telegram messages because you have full control over your personal instance of TelePilot, 
which runs on your self-hosted n8n instance. The choice of hosting environment is entirely up to you. 

Whether you prefer the convenience of cloud hosting or the control of running it on your own machine, TelePilot allows you to make that decision. 

Probably the fastest way to get everything up and running would be using Railway n8n template:

 - [Railway](https://railway.app/new/template/zo8wVU)

If you are technically inclined, you can even launch it on your homelab or Raspberry Pi. 
For a hassle-free experience, take one of these templates for self-hosting:

 - [n8n on Cloudron](https://www.cloudron.io/store/io.n8n.cloudronapp.html)
 - [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org/en/app_n8n) / [YunoHost n8n app on github](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/n8n_ynh)
 - https://timeweb.cloud/ ?
